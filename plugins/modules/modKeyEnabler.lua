    Mod Key Enabler is designed to generate more specific key events
    based upon a key being pressed while a modifier key is down.
    
    For example, an uppercase A is written with a shift keypress and
    an 'a' keypress. Both of these are ordinarily separate events.
    However, if the shift is held down, this manager should
    transmit an 'A' keypressed key.
    
    A shift keypress can be either an 'lshift' or an 'rshift'.
