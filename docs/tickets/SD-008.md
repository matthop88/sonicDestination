## Rings implemented

Type: STORY

### Description:
Rings are placed in the Green Hill Zone, in the exact same places as in Sonic 1 GHZ Act 1.
Rings that are behind trees or other objects can be drawn in the foreground.
Rings animate smoothly and asynchronously as per Sonic 1.
When Sonic collides with a ring, it dissolves with a twinkling animation.

Sound alternately pans from the left ear to the right ear as rings are collected.
