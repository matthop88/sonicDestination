## Rings implemented

Type: STORY

### Description:
Rings are placed in the Green Hill Zone, in the exact same places as in Sonic 1 GHZ Act 1.
Rings that are behind trees or other objects can be drawn in the foreground.
Rings animate smoothly and asynchronously as per Sonic 1.
When Sonic collides with a ring, it dissolves with a twinkling animation.
Rings are drawn behind Sonic, but the twinkling is drawn in front of Sonic.

Sound alternately pans from the left ear to the right ear as rings are collected.
