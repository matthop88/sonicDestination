Type: STORY

### Description:
Chunks of Green Hill Zone are drawn simulating a world as in the game.

Some of the tiles can be solid on the top, allowing Sonic to land on them.

### Acceptance Criteria: 
- [X] Green Hill Zone chunks are drawn on screen in a realistic zone format
- [X] Implementation is done on a tile-based basis
- [X] Tile solidity implemented
- [X] Sonic can land on solid tiles
- [X] Sonic can fall through non-solid tiles
