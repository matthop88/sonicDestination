## Draw Sonic the Hedgehog Sprite on screen

Type: STORY

### Description:
The very first step in implementing the Sonic the Hedgehog game is
to have a Sonic sprite drawn onto a game window. <br/>
The sprite should (for now) be a static, non-animating image
and should look very much like Sonic's sprite from the Genesis classic,
Sonic the Hedgehog 1.

### Acceptance Criteria: 
- Game Window is created
	- Window Title:      Sonic Destination
	- Window Dimensions: 1024 x 768
	- Window displayed on 2nd monitor (TEMPORARY)
- Workspace is drawn on Game Window
	- Dark green background
	- Thick horizontal white line 3/4 of the way down the screen
- Sonic the Hedgehog sprite is drawn on top of the Workspace
	- In right-facing standing position
	- Drawn at a reasonable scale
	- Drawn without pixel blurring
	- Positioned so that he is:
		- Centered horizontally
		- Standing on the white line
