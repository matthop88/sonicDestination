## Sonic the Hedgehog Sprite tracks with mouse

Type: STORY

### Description:
This should be a trivial step.<br/>

the Sonic sprite follows the mouse around the screen.<br/>
Pressing the 'm' key again returns Sonic to standing on the line.

### Acceptance Criteria: 
- [X] Sonic follows mouse around screen when 'm' is pressed
- [X] Sonic snaps back to standing on line when 'm' is pressed again
- [X] Mouse tracking code is implemented as a plugin
