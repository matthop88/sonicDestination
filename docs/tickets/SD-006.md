## Sonic the Hedgehog can jump, with animation and sound

Type: STORY

### Description:
Sonic can jump.
While airborne, he can accelerate and decelerate according to the rules conveyed by
http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide

Jump sound occurs when jumping.

When landing, Sonic enters the same state he was in prior to jumping, unless a state change has been triggered due to movement while in the air.
The exception to this is braking: Sonic never reenters the braking state, but instead enters decelerate left or decelerate right.

Sonic can demonstrate a "variable height" jump. If the player holds the jump button, Sonic's jump height is higher, as opposed to releasing the jump button quickly after pressing it.

Sonic's jump animation is in place. Speed of jump animation is a function of how fast Sonic is moving.
If Sonic is moving fast enough, an extra "ball" frame is added to Sonic's jump animation.

A phenomenon called "Air Drag" occurs when Sonic is jumping, to add a bit of friction when Sonic is moving horizontally during a jump.
This is also described by the Sonic Physics Guide.

### Acceptance Criteria: 
- [X] Model for jumping and landing is created inside state machine
- [X] Model for jumping is implemented in game
- [X] Jump sound is added
    - As an option, can switch to the Sonic CD Jump Sound by changing a property
- [X] Sonic's jump animation is added
    - Speed of jump animation is function of how fast Sonic is moving
    - If Sonic is moving fast enough, an extra "ball" frame is added to Sonic's jump animation.
    - Jump animation is also implemented for Sonic 2 mode
- [X] Variable Jump Height implemented
- [X] Air Drag implemented
