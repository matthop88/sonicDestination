## Giant Rings implemented

Type: STORY

### Description:
Giant rings can be placed in Green Hill Zone.
At first, there will be one giant ring in the exact place it appears in GHZ Sonic 1.
Giant ring only shows up if Sonic has collected at least 50 rings.
Giant ring animates as per Sonic 1.
Sonic can leap into center of ring, whereupon it fwooshes and disappears, along with Sonic and cool sound.
After Sonic vanishes, screen fades to white and warping sound is played.
After warping, the act resets with Sonic at the left.

Rings can also be set up as destination rings. They are nonexistent at first, and warp into existence, with Sonic jumping out of them.

If there are multiple destination rings, they can be selected randomly or specifically paired.

Bonus: special effects ring gleam
