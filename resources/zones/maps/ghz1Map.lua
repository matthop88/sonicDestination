--[[
    This has been reduced from 90 chunks down to 38, using a combination of the Chunkalyzer and MapViewer applications.

    The image size of all the chunks is now 112K, which is 56.9% of the size of the original image (202K).

    And we're just getting started. 

    Our next goal: 15K or less.

    Is it even possible?
